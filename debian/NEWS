xserver-xorg-input-keyboard (1:1.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The old "keyboard" driver has been removed and is now superseded by the
  "kbd" driver. The corresponding "InputDevice" section in the xorg.conf
  configuration file should be updated by replacing "keyboard" with "kbd"
  on the "Driver" line.
